[[https://github.com/tamura70/taocp-sat/][This repository]] provides Linux binaries and PDF files produced from the CWEB programs written by [[https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/][Donald E. Knuth]] for "Satisfiability", Volume 4 Fascicle 6 of [[https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html][The Art of Computer Programming]] (TAOCP).  The original CWEB programs were obtained on March 19, 2019 from:
  - [[https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/programs.html]]

They were compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 with TeX Live 2018 by using the following Perl script.
  - [[http://bach.istc.kobe-u.ac.jp/lect/taocp-sat/knuth/install.pl]]

There were some errors during the compilation (see the following log file).  Therefore, it is not guaranteed the compiled programs and PDFs are correct.

These programs can be executed in [[http://jupyter.org][Jupyter]] notebooks on [[https://mybinder.org][Binder]] with [[https://almond.sh][Almond]] Scala kernel.
