I had promised that the *.dat files would never change, but I learned later
that miles.dat as originally distributed used the wrong two-letter state
codes for Nebraska and Saskatchewan. This was politically incorrect.
I decided to change to the correct codes, since this won't affect any
of the data that's critical for the graph structure. Please replace your
copies of miles.dat (and cities.texmap) if they are dated earlier than 1995.

Similarly, I found an embarrassing typo ("Monsiuer" for "Monsieur") in
the file jean.dat; and there was a spurious white pixel at the very
bottom right corner of lisa.dat; those glitches were corrected in March 2007.

----------------------------------------

Here is a list of all significant changes that appeared in the third
printing of The Stanford GraphBase book (2002). Corrections marked with *
were already made in the second printing (1994); see the webpage
  http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb.html
for corrections to any subsequent printings. If you know of an error not
listed here or there, chances are good that you can earn a reward
by reporting it to sgb@cs.stanford.edu. [Note that comparison between pointers
from differently calloc'd regions of memory is not considered erroneous; see
the README file.]  Many thanks to the readers who reported these glitches.

Page 217, insert a new paragraph at the beginning of section 6:
The numbers generated by |gb_next_rand()| seem to be satisfactory for most
purposes, but they do fail a stringent test called the ``birthday spacings
test,'' devised by George Marsaglia. [See, for example, {\sl Statistics and
Probability Letters\/ \bf9} (1990), 35--39.] One way to get numbers that
pass the birthday test is to discard half of the values, for example
by changing `|gb_flip_cycle()|' to `|gb_flip_cycle(),gb_flip_cycle()|'
in the definition of |gb_next_rand()|. Users who wish to make such a change
should define their own substitute macro.

Page 282, after #include <stdio.h>: also say #include <stdlib.h> (twice)

*Page 287, insert a new paragraph after line 4, to wit: {\sl Important Note:\/}
Programs of the Stanford GraphBase implicitly assume that all memory allocated
by |calloc| comes from a single underlying memory array.  Therefore pointer
values are compared to each other in many places, even when the objects
pointed to have been allocated at different times. Strictly speaking, this
liberal use of pointer comparisons fails to conform to the restrictions of
ANSI Standard \CEE/, when the comparison involves a less-than or greater-then
relation. Users whose system supports only the strict standard will need to
make several dozen changes.

*Page 288, section 18, line 11: replace "g->uu.I++;" by the code
   { g->uu.I++; printf("."); fflush(stdout); }

(this affects the mini-indexes on pages 337, 339, 341)

Page 336, lines 22 and 23: change "SA" to "SK" and delete the sentence
about New Brunswick vs Nebraska (Nebraska changed from NB to NE long ago!)

Page 354, section 23. The displayed formulas should define functions
ff, gg, hh, and jj (not f, g, h, and j)

*Page 366, section 2, line 6: should say {1,3,4,9,10,12}
